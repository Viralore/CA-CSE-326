        <h1 id="h-11">The Importance of Exercise</h1>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">We all know that exercise is important in our daily lives, but we may not know why or what exercise can do for us.</p>
        <p id="p-11">It’s important to remember that we have evolved from nomadic ancestors who spent all their time moving around in search of food and shelter, travelling large distances on a daily basis. Our bodies are designed and have evolved to be regularly
            active.
        </p>
        <p id="p-11">In the same way that a sports car is designed to go fast, we are designed to move. If the sports car is taken out once a week for a 3 mile round trip through a town centre then it would probably develop engine problems fairly quickly.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Over time people too develop problems if they sit down all day at a desk or in front of the TV and minimise the amount of exercise they do.</p>

        <h2 id="h-22">The Benefits of Exercise</h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">There are many benefits of regular exercise and maintaining fitness and these include:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>Exercise increases energy levels</li>
            <p id="p-11">Exercise improves both the strength and the efficiency of your cardiovascular system to get the oxygen and nutrients to your muscles. When your cardiovascular system works better everything seems easier and you have more energy for the fun
                stuff in life.</p>
            <li>Exercise improves muscle strength</li>
            <p id="p-11">Staying active keeps muscles strong and joints, tendons and ligaments flexible, allowing you to move more easily and avoid injury. Strong muscles and ligaments reduce your risk of joint and lower back pain by keeping joints in proper alignment.
                They also improve coordination and balance.</p>
            <li>Exercise can help you to maintain a healthy weight</li>
            <p id="p-11">The more you exercise, the more calories you burn. In addition, the more muscle you develop, the higher your metabolic rate becomes, so you burn more calories even when you’re not exercising. The result? You may lose weight and look better
                physically which will boost your self-esteem.</p>
            <li>Exercise improves brain function</li>
            <p id="p-11">Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen levels in the brain. It also encourages the release of the brain chemicals (hormones) that are responsible for the production of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that controls memory
                and learning. This, in turn, boosts concentration levels and cognitive ability, and helps reduce the risk of cognitive degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
            <li>Exercise is good for your heart</li>
            <p id="p-11">Exercise reduces LDL cholesterol (the type that clogs your arteries), increases HDL (the good cholesterol) and reduces blood pressure so it lowers the stress on your heart. Added to this, it also strengthens your heart muscle. Combined with
                a healthy diet, exercise lowers the risk of developing coronary heart disease.</p>
            <li>Regular exercise lowers your risk of developing type 2 diabetes</li>
            <p id="p-11">Regular exercise helps to control blood glucose levels, which helps to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Additionally exercise helps to prevent obesity, which is a primary factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.</p>
            <li>Exercise enhances your immune system</li>
            <p id="p-11">Exercise improves your body’s ability to pump the oxygen and nutrients around your body that are required to fuel the cells that fight bacteria and viruses.</p>
            <li>Staying active reduces the likelihood of developing some degenerative bone diseases</li>
            <p id="p-11">Weight bearing exercise such as running, walking or weight training lowers your risk of both osteoarthritis and osteoporosis – the adage of “use it or lose it” really does apply to bones.</p>
            <li>Exercise may help to reduce the risk of certain cancers</li>
            <p id="p-11">Being fit may mean that the risks of colon cancer, breast cancer and possibly also lung and endometrial cancers are reduced. Studies by the Seattle Cancer Research Centre have suggested that 35% of all cancer deaths are linked to being overweight
                and sedentary.</p>
            <li>Active people tend to sleep better</li>
            <p id="p-11">Physical activity makes you more tired so you’re more ready to sleep. Good quality sleep helps improve overall wellness and can reduce stress.</p>
            <li>Exercise improves your mood and gives you an improved sense of well-being</li>
            <p id="p-11">Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins which make you feel better and more relaxed. These in turn improve your mood and lower your stress levels.</p>
            <li>Exercise can help prevent and treat mental illnesses like depression</li>
            <p id="p-11">Physical activity can help you meet people, reduce stress levels, cope with frustration, give you a sense of achievement, and provide some important “me time”, all of which help with depression.</p>
            <li>Keeping fit can reduce some of the effects of ageing</li>
