            1. The Mediterranean diet
        </h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">
            The Mediterranean diet has long been considered the gold standard for nutrition, disease prevention, wellness, and longevity. This is based on its nutrition benefits and sustainability.
        </p>
        <h3 id="h-33">
            How it works
        </h3>
        <p id="p-11">The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have traditionally eaten. It is rich in:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>vegetables</li>
            <li>fruits</li>
            <li>whole grains</li>
            <li>fish</li>
            <li>nuts</li>
            <li>lentils</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p-11">Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>refined grains</li>
            <li>trans fats</li>
            <li>processed meats</li>
            <li>added sugar</li>
            <li>other highly processed foods</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="IMGS/Diet Plans/The Mediterranean diet.jpg" height="500px" width="700px" id="img_diet">
        <h3 id="h-33">
            Health benefits
        </h3>
        <p id="p-11">This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain.
            cancers. </p>
        <p id="p-11">Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss.</p>
        <p id="p-11">A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low fat diet, the Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low carb diet, it produced similar weight loss results.</p>
        <p id="p-11">One study in more than 500 adults over 12 months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with double the likelihood of weight loss maintenance.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Other benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of mental disorders, including cognitive decline and depression.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Downsides</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it’s important to make sure you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box-2">
        <h2 id="h-22">2. The DASH diet</h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, is an eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure, which is clinically known as hypertension.</p>
        <p id="p-11">It emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. It is low in salt, red meat, added sugars, and fat.</p>
        <p id="p-11">While the DASH diet is not a weight loss diet, many people report losing weight on it.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">How it works</h3>
        <p id="p-11">The DASH diet recommends specific servings of different food groups. The number of servings you are encouraged to eat depends on your daily calorie intake.</p>
        <p id="p-11">For example, each day an average person on the DASH diet would eat about:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>five servings of vegetables</li>
            <li>five servings of fruit</li>
            <li>seven servings of healthy carbs like whole grains</li>
            <li>two servings of low fat dairy products</li>
            <li>two servings or fewer of lean meats</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p-11">In addition, it’s recommended to consume nuts and seeds two to three times per week.</p>
        <img src="IMGS/Diet Plans/The DASH diet.jpg" height="500px" width="700px" id="img_diet">
        <h3 id="h-33">Health benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">The DASH diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels and several heart disease risk factors. Also, it may help lower your risk of breast and colorectal cancers.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Studies show that the DASH diet can also help you lose weight. For example, an analysis of 13 studies found that people on the DASH diet lost more weight over 8–24 weeks than people on a control diet.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Another study in adults with obesity over 12 weeks found that the DASH diet helped decrease total body weight, body fat percentage, and absolute fat mass in study participants while preserving muscle strength.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Other benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">In addition to weight loss, the DASH diet may help combat depression symptoms.</p>
        <p id="p-11">A comparative study over 8 years found that even moderate adherence to the DASH diet was related to lower depression risk.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Downsides</h3>
        <p id="p-11">While the DASH diet may aid with weight loss and lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, there is mixed evidence on salt intake and blood pressure.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Eating too little salt has been linked to increased insulin resistance, and a low sodium diet isn’t the right choice for everyone.</p>
        <p id="p-11">A low sodium diet like the DASH diet is more appropriate for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions that benefit from or require sodium restriction</p>
        <p id="p-11">More research is needed in this area to understand how a low sodium diet can affect insulin resistance in individuals without hypertension.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box-3">
        <h2 id="h-22">3. Plant-based and flexitarian diets</h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions of plant-based diets, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.</p>
        <p id="p-11">However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet. This is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">How it works</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Typical vegetarian diets restrict meat of all kinds but allow dairy products. Typical vegan diets restrict all animal products, including dairy, butter, and sometimes other byproducts like honey.</p>
        <p id="p-11">The flexitarian eating plan does not have clear-cut rules or recommendations about calories and macronutrients, so it’s considered more of a lifestyle than a diet. Its principles include:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>consuming protein from plants instead of animals</li>
            <li>eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains</li>
            <li>eating the least processed, most natural forms of foods</li>
            <li>limiting sugar and sweets</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p-11">Additionally, it allows the flexibility to consume meat and animal products from time to time.</p>
        <img src="IMGS/Diet Plans/Plant-based and flexitarian diets.png" height="500px" width="700px" id="img_diet">
        <h3 id="h-33">Health benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Numerous studies have shown that plant-based diets can reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases, including improved markers of metabolic health, decreased blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. They can also help you lose
            weight.
        </p>
        <p id="p-11">Flexitarian diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and improve metabolic health and blood pressure, plus may have their own weight loss benefits.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Other benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">For those who are looking to lead a sustainable lifestyle, decreasing your meat consumption can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and soil degradation.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Downsides</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Plant-based eating patterns like vegetarianism and veganism can sometimes be difficult to maintain and may feel restricting, especially if you’re switching from a more meat-based eating style.</p>
        <p id="p-11">And while the flexibility of the flexitarian diet makes it easy to follow, being too flexible with it may counteract its benefits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box-4">
        <h2 id="h-22">4. The MIND diet</h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets to create an eating pattern that focuses on brain health.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">How it works</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Like the flexitarian diet, the MIND diet does not have a strict meal plan, but instead encourages eating 10 specific foods with brain health benefits.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Per week, MIND includes eating:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>six or more servings of green, leafy vegetables</li>
            <li>one serving of non-starchy vegetables</li>
            <li>five or more servings of nuts</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p-11">Other foods it encourages multiple times a week include:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>berries</li>
            <li>beans</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>whole grains</li>
            <li>fish</li>
            <li>poultry</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="IMGS/Diet Plans/The MIND diet.jpg" height="500px" width="700px" id="img_diet">
        <h3 id="h-33">Health benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Research shows that the MIND diet may reduce a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and studies show that the MIND diet is superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Research also shows that the MIND diet can help slow cognitive decline and improve resiliency in older adults.</p>
        <p id="p-11">It may also help delay the onset of the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease.</p>
        <p id="p-11">There is little research concerning the MIND diet and weight loss. Yet, since it is a combination of two diets that promote weight loss, the MIND diet may also help you lose weight.</p>
        <p id="p-11">One way it can help promote weight loss is that it encourages limiting your consumption of foods like:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>red meat</li>
            <li>fried food</li>
            <li>sweets</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p-11">However, more research needs to be done concerning the MIND diet and weight loss.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Other benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">By combining the best of two diets, the MIND diet has a lot to offer and offers some more flexibility than stricter diets.</p>
        <p id="p-11">While you can eat more than the 10 food groups it recommends, the closer you stick to the diet, the better your results may be.</p>

        <h2 id="h-22">5. Intermittent fasting</h2>
        <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0;border-top: 4px solid #926239;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <p id="p-11">Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day. There’s also the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories twice per week.</p>
        <p id="p-11">While it’s primarily known as a diet for weight loss, intermittent fasting may have powerful benefits for both your body and brain.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">How it works</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.</p>
        <img src="IMGS/Diet Plans/Intermittent fasting.jpg" height="500px" width="700px" id="img_diet">
        <h3 id="h-33">Health benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Both animal and human studies show that intermittent fasting may also increase heart health and extend lifespan</p>
        <p id="p-11">It can also help you lose weight.</p>
        <p id="p-11">In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 0.8–13% weight loss over a period of 2 weeks to 1 year. This is a significantly greater percentage than many other methods.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Other benefits</h3>
        <p id="p-11">While certain diets can have a lot of rules, require frequent trips to the grocery store, and can be difficult to follow, intermittent fasting is known as a more simple-to-follow eating plan.</p>
        <p id="p-11">Due to the nature of the diet, there are fewer meals that you need to prepare, cook, and clean up after.</p>
        <h3 id="h-33">Downsides</h3>
        <p id="p-11">In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.</p>
        <p id="p-11">That said, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels should talk with a health professional before starting intermittent fasting. These groups include people:</p>
        <ul id="ul-1">
            <li>who have diabetes</li>
            <li>who have low weight</li>
            <li>who have an eating disorder</li>
            <li>who are pregnant</li>
            <li>who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding</li>
